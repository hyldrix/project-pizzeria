# Project - Single Page Application - Pizzeria

This Single Page Application (SPA) caters to pizzerias and is structured into three primary sections: Home, Order, and Booking.

The "Home" section provides general information and showcases several engaging CSS effects.
The "Order" section offers an interactive experience, allowing users to select ingredients with SVG image displays, add them to the cart, and adjust order quantities.
The "Booking" section displays the restaurant layout, enables users to check table availability, and reserve specific tables.

Project was part of introduction to object-oriented programing. During the task I understood the difference between functional and OOP programming. I have also learned how to use Habdlebars templating library and how templating libraries are working in general.

I learned how to work with APIs, how to use JSON and AJAX
